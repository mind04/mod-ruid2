ABOUT
mod_ruid2 is a suexec module for apache 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4, based on mod_ruid and mod_suid2

-it runs only on Linux because only the Linux kernel has implemented the required process capabilities.
-it has better performance than mod_suid2 because it doesn`t need to kill httpd children
 after one request. it makes use of kernel capabilites and after receiving a new request suids again.
-there are some security issues, for instance if attacker successfully exploits the httpd process,
 he can set effective capabilities and setuid to root. i recommend to use some security patch in kernel (grsec),
 or something..

-there are two main operation modes: stat and config
 1. config
 is default, you must define uid and gid. If no [ug]id is defined the default user and group are used.

 2. stat
 httpd setuid and setgid to uid and gid of requested filename(script)/directory
 this is good if you use mod_vhost_alias for virtual hosting

INSTALL
 1. download and install latest libcap from here
 2. run /apachedir/bin/apxs -a -i -l cap -c mod_ruid2.c
 3. configure httpd.conf
 4. restart apache
